   python3 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   You'll know the virtual environment is activated when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Get a Google Gemini API key:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

   - Create a new API key
   - Copy your API key

5. Configure your API key:
   - Open the `.env` file
   - Replace the placeholder value with your Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
     ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to:

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors when running the application:

1. **API Key Issues**: 
   - Make sure you have a valid Gemini API key in your `.env` file
   - Verify that you have access to the Gemini API (some regions may have restrictions)

   - Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
